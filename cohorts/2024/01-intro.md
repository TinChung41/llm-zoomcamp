Note for LLM and RAG

## RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation 
Retrieval = Search

Generation = LLM

If we want to ask, "Is it too late for me to join the course?" the language model might not know what course we are talking about. 
It might respond with something like, "I can help you, but I need to know more details. Can you tell me more about that?" The reason we
want to use search is to provide more information and context so the language model can give a better answer. For example, another question 
could be, "How do I enroll in the course?" Again, without context, the language model might give a nonsensical answer.

Search will give more information and context, get information from a knowledge base and give it to the LLM for giving the answer for user's question
